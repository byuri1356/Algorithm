### 문제 설명

<p>The Bytean cross spider (Araneida baitoida) is known to have an amazing ability. Namely, it can instantly build an arbitrarily large spiderweb as long as it is contained in a single plane. This ability gives the spider an opportunity to use a fancy hunting strategy. It does not need to wait until a fly is caught in an already built spiderweb; if only the spider knows the current position of a fly, it can instantly build a spiderweb to catch the fly.</p>

<p>A cross spider has just spotted n flies in Byteasar’s garden. Each fly is flying still in some point of a 3D space. The spider is wondering if it can catch all the flies with a single spiderweb. Write a program that answers the spider’s question.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The following n lines contain a description of the flies in a 3D space: the i-th line contains three integers x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> (−1 000 000 , x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> , 1 000 000) giving the coordinates of the i-th fly (a point in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space). No two flies are located in the same point.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program should output a single word TAK (i.e., yes in Polish) if the spider can catch all the flies with a single spiderweb. Otherwise your program should output the word NIE (no in Polish).</p>
